### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Theo Anderson store data.xlsx" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Modification, Data Analysis, Creating Reports.


### Data Cleaning and Preparation 

1. The dataset was already clean and free from missing or inconsistent values.
2. Data Preparation involved using Excels's Sort and Filter functions to isolate relevant records required for the analysis.
3. The data was organized and structured to improve readability and ensure it was analysis-ready.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as

- The total sales and profit of the business during weekends?
- The total sales and profit of the business on weekdays?


### Data Analysis

- Data Analysis was performed in Excel using formulas and functions such as SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, etc to compute key metrics.
- PivotTables were used to summarize the data, identify patterns, and compare values across categories.

### Results and Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1.Weekend operations are not profitable for most superstores.
2.Weekend sales are significantly lower, and total profit generated is not sustainable in the long term.
3.Weekday profits are more than double weekend profits, showing that the business generates much higher returns during weekdays.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
-Conduct root cause analysis, review market data, gather customer feedback, and check operations.
-Focus marketing campaigns on Apparel, Golf, and Electronics to drive higher sales.
-Increase marketing in USA and Mexico to capture untapped opportunities.
-Introduce loyalty programs, targeted campaigns, and incentives to re-engage lost customers.
